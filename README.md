Introduction

The Simple Calculator is a GUI-based Java application developed using the Swing library. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user inputs two numbers, selects an operation, and the result is displayed in the result field.

Project Objectives

1. Build a user-friendly interface for a basic calculator using Java Swing.
2. Enable arithmetic operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
3. Display error messages for invalid inputs or divide-by-zero operations.
4. Provide a clear/reset feature to reset the input fields and result.

Features

1. Graphical User Interface (GUI): Uses Java Swing components such as JTextField, JButton, JLabel, JPanel.

2. Basic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

3. Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs and division by zero.

4  Reset Button: Clears all input fields and the result display.

5. Responsive Design: Components are well-aligned with appropriate padding and spacing.

Tools and Technologies Used

1. Programming Language: Java

2. GUI Library: Java Swing

3. Development Environment: Any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans) or Java compiler (JDK).
